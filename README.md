# Bankist-Ui
JavaScript,
This project is made for using event bubbling that is in nav bar, the Intersection Observer API  and the lazy loading for img to increase the loading performance of the page. This behavior is made with vanilla javascript. For code you can visit the source  from GitHub
this concept, design belongs to my teacher Jonas Schmedtmann
